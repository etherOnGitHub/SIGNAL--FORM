# SIGNAL//FORM

SIGNAL//FORM is an experimental, local-first system built around a modular audio pipeline where analysis, processing, and transformation are treated as explicit, ordered stages. The project prioritises clear boundaries, reproducible signal flow, and chain-level control, allowing components to be rearranged, bypassed, or extended as the system evolves.
